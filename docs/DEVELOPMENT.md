# Development Guide

English | [한국어](DEVELOPMENT.kr.md) · [Project overview](../README.md)

## Build environment

Use JDK 17. The project targets Minecraft 1.20.1 and Forge 47.4.10, using the Gradle 8.8 wrapper.

```bash
./gradlew build
```

On Windows, use `.\gradlew.bat` in place of `./gradlew`.

The runnable artifact is `build/libs/slimic-1.20.1-<version>.jar`. The `-sources.jar` artifact is for development.

## Development tasks

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `./gradlew runClient` | Launch the development client. |
| `./gradlew runServer` | Launch a local development server. |
| `./gradlew runGameTestServer` | Run the dedicated Forge GameTest server. |
| `./gradlew runData` | Run configured data generators. |

GameTests run in `build/game-test-server`, separate from the normal development world under `run`. Their Java sources and fixtures live in `src/gameTest` and are excluded from release artifacts. The build compiles the GameTests; `runGameTestServer` executes them.

## Source layout

- `src/main/java`: mod entry point, registries, slime behavior, item interactions, and client rendering.
- `src/main/resources`: metadata, textures, translations, recipes, and loot tables.
- `src/generated/resources`: generated production resources when needed.
- `src/gameTest`: development-only test mod, tests, and structures.
- `docs`: detailed gameplay and development guides in English and Korean.

Keep each README focused on the project overview and links. Maintain detailed guides as English/Korean pairs.

Package only runtime assets used by the mod in `src/main/resources`; keep reference material and verification artifacts outside the release resources.

## Versions and changes

Early development releases use the `0.1.x` series, with a patch increment for each release. Update `mod_version` in `gradle.properties` and [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) together; the build verifies the changelog entry.

Keep the development test-mod version in sync when changing the release version.

## Slime recovery data

A recovered item stores the slime's complete serialized state in `SlimeData`, including Forge persistent data and capabilities. New persistent slime traits should use the entity's standard save/load hooks so they automatically survive recovery.

Restoration loads the saved state and retains the original UUID and owner. It replaces placement, motion, and fall distance for the new destination and does not restore leash or passenger relationships. A loaded entity with the same UUID prevents another release of that stored identity.

Recovered items have a stack limit of one. Their release consumes the stored item even through Creative mode's normal item-count restoration. Newly crafted items retain the usual Creative reuse behavior.

## Validation

Format all Java sources with Google Java Format before completing a change.

Run `build` and `runGameTestServer` after gameplay changes. Coverage includes crafting, normal spawning, recovery and release, health and other traits, ownership, full inventories, blocked placement, Creative use, persistence, following, and death behavior.

Tests use a structure loaded one block above its marker, so the fixture floor is at relative Y=1. Keep world fixtures separate from production assets.

## Stats, mining, and integrations

Shared stat levels are synchronized as entity data. Server-side menu checks enforce ownership, distance, available points, and upgrade limits. Rename packets apply only to the sender's active Slime menu. Health upgrades change the maximum without healing the companion.

Mining state, bag contents, stamina, and activity progress use the standard entity save/load hooks. The equipped pickaxe and shovel use the native main-hand and off-hand equipment slots, keeping client rendering and item damage synchronized. Mining progress is bounded by one completed block per tick, searches process a limited number of chunk positions, and no neighbouring chunk is loaded for target discovery.

The crafting serializer copies the Friendly Slime's stored traits and the exact pickaxe stack into the result. JEI is a compile-only API dependency with optional development runtime support. Use `./gradlew runClient -PenableJei=false` or `./gradlew runGameTestServer -PenableJei=false` to validate operation without JEI. Common game logic does not reference JEI or client classes.

## Transport and storage

`BagSlime` shares capacity-aware storage, death drops, save/load, and recovery between worker types. Mining retains the `MiningBag` NBT key for existing saves; transport uses `TransportBag` with up to 54 slots. Transport capacity multiplies the common base and every upgrade by two. Its menu has no equipment slot and checks the active page on the server.

Transport tasks query loaded chunks for Slime Chest block entities and same-owner workers inside the release-centered detection area. Transfers simulate available capacity before moving items on the server thread. Work requests are revalidated before transfer so concurrent carriers cannot duplicate tools or replace a tool already supplied. Travel targets are transient; cargo and orders are persistent, so interrupted jobs can be selected again after load or release.

Slime Chests use a standard 27-slot container menu and Forge item capability, with normal inventory persistence, locks, comparator updates, and separate block/content drops. Regular chests are excluded from logistics.

Validation covers all Capacity levels, both bag pages, ownership, full and partial destinations, concurrent tool supply, tool data and breakage, mining resumption, chest persistence/automation/drops, and transport recovery. Client checks cover both specializations, page synchronization, chest menus, model resources, and optional JEI recipes.

## Quarry, tuning, and herald persistence

Mining uses native main-hand pickaxe and off-hand shovel equipment. `MiningQuarry` retains the chunk's entry elevation and current layer; same-chunk release resumes it, while another chunk creates a new plan and resumes work. The perimeter plan reserves two-wide full-block treads with flat corners. Repair consumes items from `slimic:quarry_supports` and honors placement events. Target scans are bounded to 256 positions per layer and a limited number of empty layers per update.

Dye IDs and custom work stats use synchronized entity data. Native attribute tuning edits base values and preserves modifiers. The creative-only tuner validates the active menu, held tool, dimension, distance, finite values, ranges, and occupied bag slots on the server before applying any changes.

Herald recipes store the exact rocket stack. Signals are vanilla firework entities marked for damage suppression. Workers save their continuous blocked duration and episode identifier; heralds save warning history and cooldowns so recovery cannot repeat an existing warning. Server configuration supplies the default delay.

Client rendering applies a brightness-preserving dye shader to the original slime texture while leaving equipment unchanged. Optional JEI previews include every specialization. Validate client shader loading, translated screens, tuner packets, creative defaults, two tool slots, and JEI enabled/disabled alongside dedicated-server tests.
